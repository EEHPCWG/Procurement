\begin{itemize}

\item[(info)]
Since power and energy costs, both operational and capital, are increasingly significant, it is very important to understand the power and energy efficiency requirements of the system.  This is best understood when running workloads; either applications or benchmarks.  Each site will have to select the workloads to run as part of the procurement and acceptance process.  These workloads may differentially exercise or stress various sub-systems; compute (CPU, GPGPU, etc.), I/O, Networks (Internal, facility and WAN).  They may focus on applications that are based on integer as well as floating point computations.

\item[(mandatory)]
[Customer] shall specify the set of benchmarks they want. Vendors shall provide the power and energy efficiency requirements, and run times of a set of benchmarks. 

\item[(mandatory)]
The types of problem in the benchmarks shall cover compute problems, memory problems, networking problems, idle and sleep system state

\item[(info)]
Suggested examples: HPL (compute problem), Integer-dominant codes (compute problem), Graph500 (memory/networking problem), GUPS, GUPPIE,  mySQL and non-mySQL database applications, and systemBurn developed at ORNL. 

\item[(mandatory)]
Customers shall specify the run rules and the measurement quality. Each benchmark must be measurable using the Green500 run rules and attain a Level 2 measurement quality. 

\item[(important)]
Customers shall specify the run rules and the measurement quality. Each benchmark must be measurable using the Green500 run rules and attain a Level 3 measurement quality. 

\item[(important)]
Vendors shall work with Customers to provide the power and energy effiency requirements of a set of site-supplied workloads. These workloads will reflect the typical case, not the extremes so that vendors can design around the typical case. 

\item[(important)]
Customers may also require application power profiles with power and energy requirements.
