\section{Liquid Cooling}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(info)]
For systems designed to be liquid-cooled, there is an opportunity for large energy savings compared to air-cooled designs.  Since liquids have more heat capacity than air, smaller volumes can achieve the same level of cooling and can be transported with minimal energy use.  In addition, if heat can be removed through a fluid phase change, heat removal capacity is further increased.  By bringing the liquid closer to the heat source, effective cooling can be provided with higher temperature fluids.  The higher temperature liquid cooling can be produced without the need for compressor based cooling.

\item[(info)]
[Customer] will specify the type of liquid cooling systems contained within the data center.  The range of liquid supply temperatures available in the center corresponding to ASHRAE recommended classes (W1-W4) will be provided to the vendor.  

\item[(info)]
A traditional data center is cooled using compressor-based cooling (i.e., chillers or CRAC units) and additional heat rejection equipment such as cooling towers or dry coolers.  These liquid-cooled systems operate within ASHRAE recommended ranges W1 and W2.  Systems designed to operate in these ranges will have limited energy efficiency capability.

\item[(important)]
For improved energy efficiency and reduced capital expense, many data centers can be operated without compressor based cooling, by using cooling towers or dry coolers combined with water-side economizers. These data centers can operate within the ASHRAE W3 range and accordingly, systems should be requested to operate in this range.

\item[(enhancing)]
In most locations liquid cooling of up to 45\celsius~can be provided using dry coolers.  The ASHRAE W4 classification was defined to accommodate this low energy form of cooling.  For this type of infrastructure, ASHRAE W4 class should be requested.  

\item[(info)]
Parameters like pressure, flow rate and water quality may also be specified by each site in their procurement documents.  ASHRAE provides guidance on these parameters, although they are not defined in this guideline.

\section{Air Cooling}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(info)]
ASHRAE Thermal Guidelines (2011) define environmental classes that allow temperatures up to 40\celsius~and
45\celsius.  

Figure~\ref{fig:ITenviron} is a pschometric chart illustratiing these new environmental temperature and humidity limits along with the recommended limits.

\item[(mandatory)]
(mandatory)	The system must be able to operate in a Class A1 environment.  

\item[(important)]
It is better to operate in a Class A2 environment (important) 

\item[(enhancing)]
All other things equal, it is best to operate in a Class A3 environment.
